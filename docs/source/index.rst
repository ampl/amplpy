AMPL Python API
===============

``amplpy`` is an interface that allows developers to access the features of `AMPL <https://ampl.com>`_ from within Python.
For a quick introduction to AMPL see `Quick Introduction to AMPL <https://dev.ampl.com/ampl/introduction.html>`_.

In the same way that AMPL's syntax matches naturally the mathematical description of the model,
the input and output data matches naturally Python lists, sets, dictionaries, ``pandas`` and ``numpy`` objects.

All model generation and solver interaction is handled directly by AMPL, which leads to
great stability and speed; the library just acts as an intermediary, and the added overhead (in terms of memory and
CPU usage) depends mostly on how much data is sent and read back from AMPL, the size of the expanded model as such is irrelevant.

With ``amplpy`` you can model and solve large scale optimization problems in Python with the performance of heavily optimized C code
without losing model readability. The same model can be deployed on applications
built on different languages by just switching the API used.

.. note::
    Many Jupyter notebooks with examples are available on the `AMPL Model Colaboratory <https://colab.ampl.com/>`_
    and the new book `Hands-On Mathematical Optimization with AMPL in Python üêç <https://ampl.com/mo-book/>`_.

    You should also check out our collection of interactive `Streamlit Apps <https://ampl.com/streamlit>`_ and
    learn how easy you can build your own apps.

Installation & minimal example
------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install Python API for AMPL
    $ python -m pip install amplpy --upgrade

    # Install solver modules (e.g., HiGHS, CBC, Gurobi)
    $ python -m amplpy.modules install highs cbc gurobi

    # Activate your license (e.g., free https://ampl.com/ce license)
    $ python -m amplpy.modules activate <license-uuid>

    # Import in Python
    $ python
    >>> from amplpy import AMPL
    >>> ampl = AMPL() # instantiate AMPL object

.. note::
  You can use a free `Community Edition license <https://ampl.com/ce>`_, which allows **free
  and perpetual use of AMPL with Open-Source solvers**. There are also free `AMPL for Courses <https://ampl.com/courses>`_ licenses that give unlimited
  access to all commercial solvers for teaching.

.. code-block:: python

    # Minimal example:
    from amplpy import AMPL
    import pandas as pd
    ampl = AMPL()
    ampl.eval(r"""
        set A ordered;
        param S{A, A};
        param lb default 0;
        param ub default 1;
        var w{A} >= lb <= ub;
        minimize portfolio_variance:
            sum {i in A, j in A} w[i] * S[i, j] * w[j];
        s.t. portfolio_weights:
            sum {i in A} w[i] = 1;
    """)
    tickers, cov_matrix = # ... pre-process data in Python
    ampl.set["A"] = tickers
    ampl.param["S"] = pd.DataFrame(cov_matrix, index=tickers, columns=tickers)
    ampl.solve(solver="gurobi", gurobi_options="outlev=1")
    assert ampl.solve_result == "solved"
    sigma = ampl.get_value("sqrt(sum {i in A, j in A} w[i] * S[i, j] * w[j])")
    print(f"Volatility: {sigma*100:.1f}%")
    # ... post-process solution in Python
