class Constraint(Entity):
    """
    Bases: :class:`~amplpy.Entity`.

    This class represents an algebraic or logical constraint. In case the
    constraint is scalar, its values can be accessed via functions like
    :func:`~amplpy.Constraint.body` and :func:`~amplpy.Constraint.dual`.
    All the AMPL suffixes for constraints (see
    http://www.ampl.com/NEW/suffbuiltin.html)
    are available through methods of this class with the same name (and methods
    of ConstraintInstance for indexed constraints).

    Note that, since this class represents both algebraic and logical
    constraints, some suffixes might not be available for every entity.

    An TypeError is thrown if one of such methods is called for
    a non-scalar constraint and if a method corresponding to a suffix which is
    not supported by the type of the constraint is called.
    A runtime error is thrown if any property of an entity which has been
    deleted from the underlying interpreter is accessed.

    To gain access to all the values in an entity (for all instances and all
    suffixes for that entities), see
    :func:`~amplpy.Entity.get_values`
    and the :class:`~amplpy.DataFrame` class.
