class Objective(Entity):
    """
    Bases: :class:`~amplpy.Entity`.

    Represents an AMPL objective. Note that, in case of a scalar objective, all
    the properties (corresponding to AMPL suffixes) of the objective instance
    can be accessed through methods like :func:`~amplpy.Objective.value`.
    The methods have the same name of the corresponding AMPL suffixes.
    See http://www.ampl.com/NEW/suffbuiltin.html for a list of the available
    suffixes.

    All these methods throw a TypeError if called for a non scalar
    objective and an RuntimeError if called on an entity which has been deleted
    in the underlying intepreter.

    To gain access to all the values in an entity (for all instances and all
    suffixes for that entities), see
    :func:`~amplpy.Entity.get_values`
    and the :class:`~amplpy.DataFrame` class.
